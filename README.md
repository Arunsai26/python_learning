During my journey of enhancing Python skills, I started with the fundamentals, mastering basic concepts such as data types, control structures, and functions. As I progressed, I explored advanced topics like basic strings and their manipulation, understanding how strings serve as another form of an array. Delving into data structures, I learned about singly linked lists and doubly linked lists, implementing operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal to optimize data storage and manipulation. Additionally, I deepened my knowledge of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction, to improve code reusability and maintainability. My learning also extended to algorithmic techniques such as searching and sorting, the two-pointer approach, and hashing for efficient problem-solving. This structured learning experience has strengthened my ability to develop scalable and optimized solutions in Python programming
